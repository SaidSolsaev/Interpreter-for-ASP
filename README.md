##Project: Interpreter for ASP (Academic Project)
An interpreter for "ASP," a custom, mini-Python-like programming language. This project, developed in Java, was an academic project in compiler and interpreter design.

#About The Project
The goal was to build a program that could read a source file written in ASP, understand its syntax, and execute the commands as written. A key requirement was to provide clear feedback to the user for any errors encountered.

#Features
- Parsing: Reads and analyzes ASP source code to build an internal representation.

- Execution: Runs the parsed code and performs the instructed operations.

- Robust Error Handling: Detects and reports a variety of errors, including:

- Syntax errors (e.g., malformed commands).

- Indentation errors (critical for a Python-like language).

- Runtime errors (if applicable).

#Technologies Used
	- Java

#Project Status
Completed. This was an academic project.
